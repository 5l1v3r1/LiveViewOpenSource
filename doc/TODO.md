# Items To Do for LiveView

## High priority items:
* Ensure that new data is added to the file buffer in SSDCamera when new images are being written to the directory
* Improve stability of frame display for CLCamera at low backend framerates (ca. 1 fps)
* Improve algorithm for computing fps to be time-based rather than frame count-based

## Medium priority items:
* Finish porting features of original LiveView to new, experimental version
* Mean filter (profile is done)
* FFT filter
* Playback widget
* Preference window
* Save server and Python client

## Low priority items:
* Show plot values on mouse hover in frameview tabs
* Allow tabs to be torn off the main window and put into new windows
* Allow dragging on the crosshair to change the range of the mean calculation.
