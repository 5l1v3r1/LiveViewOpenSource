# LiveViewOpenSource
This program is a working version of the LiveView Demo. The code from the public version of LiveView has been refactored to have no dependencies and be more operating system independent. Ultimately, this new architecture, including a new standard deviation computation implemented in OpenCL rather than CUDA, will supersede and replace the current primary version of LiveView. Additionally, this version contains a special "ssdcamera" mode which enables users to view data from the ITB directly from a hard drive. The code is use specific, and expects a certain file format developed by Didier Keymeulen.
