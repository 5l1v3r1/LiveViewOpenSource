# LiveViewOpenSource
This repository contains the open source new release of LiveView, an imaging spectrometer data visualisation program. This version improves on previous versions of LiveView by integrating all functionality into a single program, reducing the complexity of installing the software. Hardware acceleration is implemented in OpenCL instead of CUDA, and provides a greater degree of hardware compatibility compared to the prior NVIDIA-only implementation. This version also provides several new camera interfaces to provide compatibility with more types of hardware.

LiveView is compatible with MacOS and Linux (RedHat and Ubuntu).

To get started, please see the "Wiki" tab for pages on installation, driver setup, and more. For developers, see the "Projects" tab for what's currently being worked on.

## Bug Reports
Please direct all bug reports or new features to the "Issues" tab. If the issue is high priority, the current turn-around time is about 1-2 weeks.
